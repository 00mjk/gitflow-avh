General configuration

Release branch support
----------------------
- Take care of the situation where two release branches live next to each
  other. In that situation, a "finish release" action should merge back changes
  into the other release, not into 'develop'. Or at least warn about it. Or not
  support creating a new release branch if the other isn't finished yet.
